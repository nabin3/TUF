rules in patterns:
	-> there will be nested loops.
	-> for the outer loop, count the no. of lines
	-> for the inner loop, focus on the colume, connect them somehow to the rows
	-> whatever you want to print, print them inside the inner for loop
	-> observe symetry in case of some patterns.(This is optional i.e this rule doesn't need to be applied on every patternes)
