time complexity != time taken

The Rate at which the time takes increases with respect to the input size is called time complexity.

** always consider worst case senario
** avoid constants
** avoid lower values


Space complexity = auxilary space(space you take for solving a problem) + input space(space needed to store inputs)

** never ever do anything to input unless intervewire says to do so // example :for storing addition result of a+b you should not write b = a+b,cause then b will be changed
